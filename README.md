## Partner Connect Certification
In order to onboard as a partner in Databricks Partner Connect, we require partners to validate their API implementation
using the test suites provided in this project. Before running the tests against your API,
it is recommended that you run the [sample tests](#build-and-run-sample-tests) to make sure your environment is set up correctly.
Follow the below steps to run the tests against your API.
1. Create a partner config file.
2. Run certification tests.
3. Upload artifacts.

###  1. Create partner config
Partners need to create a config file to specify the partner service endpoint, and other relevant details used by the tests in this repo.
- See sample config files under `partners/test`
- See the PartnerConfig definition under `openapi/partner-connect-2.0.yaml`
- Create a config file under the `partners/test` directory and use the name of the file to run tests against it.

### 2. Run certification tests
Run the certification tests against your partner connect server using the command below.
- Setup: This step requires docker to be setup on the host machine. See [Docker setup step](#setup-docker-environment) for more detail.
- Export credentials as environment variables

```
  - export BASIC_USER=<Basic Auth user to call connect api.>
  - export BASIC_PASSWORD=<Basic Auth password to call connect api.>
  - export PAT_TOKEN=<PAT Token to send in connect api payload.>
```

- Run the tests: `./run_tests.sh partner.json` where
    - partner.json (required) is the name of the partner config file created in step 1.
    - Note: Make sure the credential environment variables are properly exported.

#### Partner Certification test cases.
Below are the test cases that are used in the partner certification. In order to get the maximum test coverage,
partners are required to implement the test hooks like delete-connection, delete-account, expire-account, test-connection, etc.

### 3. Upload artifacts
The final step is to upload the test report and configuration files to the [partner intake form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc2vcAqAOVlE7Llo3GMhLrK3klzYXQ5LeWyqaR6L20RjHpygQ/viewform).
The required artifacts from the certification steps are:
- Test report: <project-root>/target/test-reports.zip
- Partner config: <project-root>/partners/test/partner.json where partner.json is the name of configuration file created in step 1.

## Build and Run sample tests
There are two options for building and running the sample tests in this project. Both options will use the sample server implementing the partner connect api.
- Using Docker: setup is recommended for partners as it requires minimal dependency on the host machine.
- Using maven: setup is recommended for local development as it provides faster iteration.

### Using Docker
#### Setup Docker Environment
- Install docker. https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
- Verify docker is working by running `docker ps`

#### Run server
- [Export test credentials](#export-credentials-as-environment-variable)
- Run `./run_server.sh test.json 8080`
  - Replace test.json with the partner config file.
  - Replace 8080 with the port referenced by base_url in the partner config file.

#### Run tests
- In a new shell [Export test credentials](#export-credentials-as-environment-variable)
- `./run_tests.sh test.json`

### Using maven
#### Setup Environment
- Install Java JDK 11(AdoptOpenJDK JDK 11)
- `export JAVA_HOME=/Path_to_JDK_HOME`
- Install maven https://maven.apache.org/install.html

#### Code gen
- `mvn compile`

#### Format code
- `mvn spotless:apply`

#### Check format
- `mvn spotless:check`

#### Run tests
#### Export credentials as environment variable
```
  - export BASIC_USER=test_user
  - export BASIC_PASSWORD=passw0rd
  - export PAT_TOKEN=test_token
```
- Run tests with specific partner config: `mvn test -DCONFIG=interactive.json`
- Note:
  - Partner config files are located at `./partners/test`

#### Debug Tests
- You can run or debug the tests in the IDE without additional flags. By default, it will run tests against the test.json partner config. To specify specific config file you can pass the -DCONFIG=file_name.json in the IDE. Example below is for IntelliJ.

#### Generate test report
- Test reports are auto generated when running test tasks under `target/test-reports`

#### Generate license report
- run `mvn license:add-third-party`
- License will be generated at `target/generated-sources/license/THIRD-PARTY.txt`

#### Update dependencies to latest
- run `mvn versions:use-latest-releases`

#### Generate api doc
- run `./gen_doc.sh`
- Api doc will be generated under `api-doc/`

## Troubleshooting
- Changing logging level: By default the log level is set to warn. To enable request/response update logging level below:
  - Run maven commands with `mvn test -Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.defaultLogLevel=debug` or
  - Update config files
    - Open `src/main/resources/simplelogger.properties`
    - Set debug level: `org.slf4j.simpleLogger.defaultLogLevel=debug`
- Running tests fails with `[error] java.io.IOError: java.lang.RuntimeException: /packages cannot be represented as URI`.
  - Resolution:
    - Install Java JDK 11(AdoptOpenJDK JDK 11)
    - `export JAVA_HOME=/Path_to_JDK_HOME`
- Lots of compile error for missing imported classes. Eg. `[error] import org.openapitools.client.model.{PartnerConfig, ResourceToProvision}`
  - Resolution:
    - Run code gen. `mvn compile`
