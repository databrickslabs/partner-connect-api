  description: |
    # Introduction
    Partner Connect API is a service that partners implement and host to enable integration with Databricks Partner Connect (https://databricks.com/partnerconnect).
    The API will be invoked by Databricks to enable Databricks to provision resources and establish a connection with the partner product.
    The Partner Connect API is hosted by the partner. The partner has full flexibility on the exact domain name and API path to use for the endpoint.

    # Authentication
    Partner connect currently supports basic auth using the Authorization header. The partner will provide an API key for Databricks to use.
